# Bookzone

<p align="justify">
Bookzone is a platform for managing personal libraries, buying, selling and exchanging books. With it, you can search for a book and locate the nearest stores with their respective prices, as well as find ordinary people who are selling or lending the book.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The platform records the loan history of each user's books, with ratings, so that you can have the security of lending books and receiving them back in perfect condition.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The project was developed during the Collaborative Mobile Systems course at the Federal University of Amazonas in 2015.
